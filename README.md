# orangehrm-docker

- Hi, this is docker-compose.yml for old version of orangehrm (v4.10) source folder that I fixed from other sources. 

- This will allow old version of orangehrm to be installed in your machine with Docker.

- The purpose of using Docker is to allow orangehrm to be installed its own container (with php 7.4 + mariadb 10.6)

- Useful if you have many project sources inside your machine which have latest version of php and mariadb/mysql which the old version of orangehrm cannot be installed    with.

- As you know orangehrm is good and has many complex features to be explored by QA automation tester to test their skill in using automation tools
